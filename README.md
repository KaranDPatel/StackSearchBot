**Automated Error Detection and Solution Finder**

**Overview**

This project is designed to automate the process of running a Python script, detecting any errors that occur, and searching for potential solutions on Stack Overflow. It leverages Python's subprocess module to execute commands and the requests library to interact with the Stack Exchange API. The results are then presented to the user by automatically opening relevant Stack Overflow pages in the web browser.


**Features**

Automatic Error Detection: Executes a specified Python script and automatically captures any error messages.

Stack Overflow Integration: Searches Stack Overflow for possible solutions based on the detected error.

Interactive Solution Retrieval: Opens up to three relevant Stack Overflow pages in the default web browser for quick access to solutions.

Modular Design: The project is designed with modular functions, making it easy to extend and adapt.

**Prerequisites**

Python 3.x installed on your system.

Required Python packages: requests.


Installation

Clone the Repository:

git clone url

Install Required Python Packages:

pip install requests

Set Up Your Script:

Place the script you want to execute and check for errors (e.g., test.py) in the same directory as this project.

Usage

Run the Main Script:

python your_script_name.py

The main script will execute the target Python script and handle errors.
If errors are found, it will search Stack Overflow and open the most relevant results in your browser.

How It Works:

The script runs your target Python script using the execute_and_return function.

If an error is detected, the script parses the error message, searches for it on Stack Overflow using the Stack Exchange API, and opens the top 3 relevant Stack Overflow links in your browser.

File Structure

your-repo-name/

├── main.py                # Main script that handles execution and error detection

├── test.py                # Example script to be executed (replace with your own)

├── README.md              # This readme file

└── requirements.txt       # List of Python dependencies (if applicable)

**Customization**

Script to Execute: Modify the execute_and_return("python test.py") line to specify the script you want to run.

Error Message Parsing: Adjust the parsing logic in the filter_out section if your errors follow a different format.

API Query Parameters: Modify the API query in make_request() if you want to refine how Stack Overflow searches are performed (e.g., adjusting tags, sort order, etc.).
